## 1. Understanding Subnetting
Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (**subnets**). This improves **security, efficiency, and routing performance**.

### **Why Subnetting?**
- **Optimizes IP address utilization** by reducing waste
- **Enhances network performance** by reducing broadcast domains
- **Improves security** by isolating network segments
- **Simplifies network management** and troubleshooting

### **Subnetting Basics**
A subnet is created by borrowing **bits from the host portion** of an IP address. The more bits you borrow, the **more subnets you create** but with **fewer hosts per subnet**.

#### **Subnet Mask Breakdown**
A subnet mask defines which part of an IP address belongs to the **network** and which part to the **host**.

Example:
```
IP Address:    192.168.1.10   →  11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
Subnet Mask:   255.255.255.0  →  11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
```
- **Network Portion** (first 24 bits): `192.168.1`
- **Host Portion** (last 8 bits): `10`
- **Total available hosts** in this subnet: `2^8 - 2 = 254`
  (We subtract 2 for the network and broadcast addresses)

#### **Subnetting Example (Class C Network)**
We have **192.168.1.0/24** and need **4 subnets**. How many bits should we borrow?

- **Formula:** `2^borrowed bits >= required subnets`
- `2^2 = 4` → We need to borrow **2 bits**
- New subnet mask: `255.255.255.192` (`/26` notation)

Subnet breakdown:
| Subnet | Network Address | First Host | Last Host | Broadcast Address |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1      | 192.168.1.0/26 | 192.168.1.1 | 192.168.1.62 | 192.168.1.63 |
| 2      | 192.168.1.64/26 | 192.168.1.65 | 192.168.1.126 | 192.168.1.127 |
| 3      | 192.168.1.128/26 | 192.168.1.129 | 192.168.1.190 | 192.168.1.191 |
| 4      | 192.168.1.192/26 | 192.168.1.193 | 192.168.1.254 | 192.168.1.255 |

Each subnet supports **62 usable hosts** (`2^6 - 2`).

## 2. Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)
**VLSM** allows us to allocate different subnet masks within the same network to optimize IP address utilization.

### **Why VLSM?**
- Traditional subnetting wastes addresses (e.g., assigning /24 to small networks)
- VLSM allows flexible, custom subnetting **based on host requirements**

### **Example Scenario**
A company has the **192.168.1.0/24** network and needs:
- **60 hosts for Department A**
- **30 hosts for Department B**
- **10 hosts for Department C**
- **2 hosts for Department D**

#### **Step 1: Assign the right subnet masks**
| Department | Required Hosts | Needed Bits | Subnet Mask | Subnet Size |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| A          | 60            | `/26` (62 hosts) | 255.255.255.192 | 192.168.1.0/26 |
| B          | 30            | `/27` (30 hosts) | 255.255.255.224 | 192.168.1.64/27 |
| C          | 10            | `/28` (14 hosts) | 255.255.255.240 | 192.168.1.96/28 |
| D          | 2             | `/30` (2 hosts)  | 255.255.255.252 | 192.168.1.112/30 |

#### **Step 2: Assign Network Ranges**
| Department | Network Address | First Host | Last Host | Broadcast |
|------------|----------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| A          | 192.168.1.0/26  | 192.168.1.1 | 192.168.1.62 | 192.168.1.63 |
| B          | 192.168.1.64/27 | 192.168.1.65 | 192.168.1.94 | 192.168.1.95 |
| C          | 192.168.1.96/28 | 192.168.1.97 | 192.168.1.110 | 192.168.1.111 |
| D          | 192.168.1.112/30 | 192.168.1.113 | 192.168.1.114 | 192.168.1.115 |

VLSM helps us **avoid wasting IP addresses** by assigning subnets as per host needs.

## 3. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
CIDR is a method of **aggregating IP addresses** to improve routing efficiency.

### **Why CIDR?**
- Reduces routing table size (less memory & CPU usage)
- Eliminates rigid **class-based** subnetting (A, B, C)
- Helps with **IP address conservation**

### **CIDR Example: Aggregating Multiple Networks**
Instead of **four /24 networks**:
```
192.168.0.0/24
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.2.0/24
192.168.3.0/24
```
We **summarize** them as `192.168.0.0/22`, reducing four routes into one!
