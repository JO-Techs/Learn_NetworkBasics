# 🛡️ Module 13: Network Access Control (NAC) & Zero Trust Security Models

## 📌 Introduction
In today's complex network environments, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access resources is critical. This module explores **Network Access Control (NAC)** and the **Zero Trust Security Model**, detailing their importance, implementation, and real-world applications.

## 🏢 **1. Network Access Control (NAC)**

### 🔹 **What is NAC?**
**Network Access Control (NAC)** is a security solution that enforces policies on devices and users attempting to access a network. It ensures that only compliant, authenticated devices gain access to resources.

### 🔹 **Key Functions of NAC**
- **Authentication:** Verifies users and devices before granting access.
- **Authorization:** Determines the level of access based on policies.
- **Endpoint Compliance:** Ensures that devices meet security requirements (antivirus, patches, etc.).
- **Network Segmentation:** Restricts access to critical resources based on roles.

### 🔹 **Types of NAC Implementations**
| Type | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Pre-admission NAC** | Evaluates and authenticates a device before granting network access. |
| **Post-admission NAC** | Continuously monitors a device even after it connects to the network. |

### 🔹 **How NAC Works?**
1. **Device Identification:** Determines if a device is known, unknown, managed, or unmanaged.
2. **Authentication & Authorization:** Uses **RADIUS**, **LDAP**, or **Active Directory (AD)** to authenticate users.
3. **Compliance Check:** Ensures the device has updated security patches, antivirus, and proper configurations.
4. **Access Grant or Denial:** Based on compliance, the device is granted full access, restricted access, or denied entry.

### 🔹 **Example Scenario**
A company enforces **NAC** to ensure that only devices with up-to-date antivirus software can connect to the corporate Wi-Fi. If a laptop does not meet the security policy, it is redirected to a quarantine network where it must update before gaining full access.

### 🔹 **Best Practices for NAC Deployment**
- Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for access control.
- Apply **role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit user privileges.
- Continuously monitor and adapt policies using **machine learning**.
- Implement **802.1X authentication** for secure network access.
- Regularly audit and update security policies to address evolving threats.

## 🔐 **2. Zero Trust Security Model**

### 🔹 **What is Zero Trust?**
The **Zero Trust** model is a cybersecurity approach that assumes **no device or user should be trusted by default**, even if inside the network. Every access request must be verified continuously.

### 🔹 **Core Principles of Zero Trust**
1. **Verify Every User & Device** → No implicit trust.
2. **Least Privilege Access** → Users should have only the minimum access required.
3. **Microsegmentation** → Networks are divided into smaller, secure zones.
4. **Continuous Monitoring** → Logging and analytics detect anomalies.
5. **Encrypt Everything** → Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

### 🔹 **Zero Trust vs. Traditional Security**
| Feature | Traditional Security | Zero Trust |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Perimeter Security | Assumes internal network is safe | No implicit trust, continuous verification |
| Access Control | Once authenticated, access granted | Least privilege access enforcement |
| Network Segmentation | Flat or minimal segmentation | Microsegmentation |
| Threat Detection | Based on perimeter defenses | Continuous monitoring & AI-driven analytics |

### 🔹 **How Zero Trust Works?**
1. **Identify & Classify Assets** → Know what’s in your network.
2. **Enforce Identity & Access Management (IAM)** → Strong authentication with MFA.
3. **Apply Microsegmentation** → Restrict lateral movement.
4. **Monitor & Log Activity** → Use SIEM tools for anomaly detection.
5. **Respond to Incidents in Real-Time** → Automated response to threats.

### 🔹 **Example Scenario**
An employee logs into the corporate VPN from an unknown device. Under Zero Trust, the system enforces:
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
- **Device posture assessment (OS updates, security patches, antivirus check)**
- **Least privilege access** based on user role
- **Logging and alerting for unusual activities**

### 🔹 **Best Practices for Zero Trust Implementation**
- Implement **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** with MFA.
- Use **Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)** for dynamic access control.
- Continuously analyze network traffic with **AI-driven threat detection**.
- Secure endpoints with **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** solutions.
- Encrypt **all data transmissions** using TLS and VPNs.

## ⚖️ **NAC vs. Zero Trust: Which One to Use?**
| Feature | NAC | Zero Trust |
|---------|----|------------|
| Access Control | Controls access at the network level | Controls access at every level (network, apps, data) |
| Device Compliance | Ensures endpoint security before access | Assumes nothing is secure by default |
| User Verification | Uses traditional authentication methods | Requires continuous verification |
| Best For | Internal network access control | Securing cloud, remote work, and hybrid environments |

### 🔹 **Combining NAC & Zero Trust for Maximum Security**
Organizations often **combine NAC and Zero Trust** to strengthen network security. NAC ensures only compliant devices connect, while Zero Trust enforces strict access control and continuous monitoring.

---

## 📚 **Conclusion**
With increasing cyber threats, traditional perimeter security is no longer sufficient. **NAC** provides initial security by controlling network access, while **Zero Trust** extends security by continuously verifying users and devices. By implementing both, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
